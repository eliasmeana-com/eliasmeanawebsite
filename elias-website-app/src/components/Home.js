        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Elias Meana, a person with a passion for blending creativity and logic. My journey through mathematics, physics, and computer engineering has taken me from the University of Georgia to Spain, where I dove deep into advanced studies and research. Today, I work as an application engineer, building web applications and tools using languages like Python, C#, JavaScript, and SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it's not all code and equations for me. I'm an avid musician and composer. I thrive outdoors, whether itâ€™s running, hiking, swimming, or anything else that presents itself. Fluent in several languages, I enjoy connecting with people and cultures, constantly seeking new experiences that challenge and inspire me.
